# Functional VR

A library meant to (eventually) offer a functional API to make interactive and navigatable VR-scenes.

## Getting Started
To get started with development, follow the steps:  

* Clone the repo wherever you like.
* `$ cd` into the repo's directory
* Run `$ yarn` to install dependencies
* Run `$ yarn test` to startup a watching testing process
* Check your [flow-typing](flow) regularly (enable integration with your IDE if possible!)

## Building
Building is done using `webpack`.  
`$ webpack build` will provide you with a built `dist/` folder.

## API
There is no actual API yet. This part will go over potential proposals.
